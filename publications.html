      <div class="w3-content">
      <p class="w3-text-grey">This paper presents an embedded system-based solution for sensor arrays to estimate
blood glucose levels from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a patient’s breath. Support vector
machine (SVM) was trained on a general-purpose computer using an existing SVM library. A training
model, optimized to achieve the most accurate results, was implemented in a microcontroller with
an ATMega microprocessor. Training and testing was conducted using artificial breath that mimics
known VOC footprints of high and low blood glucose levels. The embedded solution was able
to correctly categorize the corresponding glucose levels of the artificial breath samples with 97.1%
accuracy. The presented results make a significant contribution toward the development of a portable
device for detecting blood glucose levels from a patient’s breath.</p>

      <h2>EMI Diagnostics of Three Phase Inverters Using Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
      <h3><a href="docs/IEEE-ECCE-2018.pdf">IEEE ECCE, 2018</a></h3>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is often re-
garded as a disturbance in electrical systems, and most research
focuses on developing techniques to mitigate its impact. EMI is
particularly problematic in many sensing applications, but there
are circumstances when EMI can be used as the sensing tool. This
paper describes a method to determine the health of the DC link
capacitance in a three-phase inverter using EMI diagnostics. The
proposed approach relies on changes in a capacitor's resonant
frequency and impedance, which occur naturally as it ages, to
predict its health. These parameters inﬂuence the conducted EMI
measurements in a manner that is detectable. Through simulation
and experimentation, it is demonstrated that this approach can
detect changes in a capacitor's health via a machine learning
algorithm that is trained to inverters EMI spectrum.</p>

      <h2>Smart wristband with integrated
chemical sensors for detecting
glucose levels using breath volatile
organic compounds</h2>
      <h3><a href="docs/SPIE.pdf">SPIE Smart Biological and Phisiological Sensing Technology, 2019</a></h3>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">This paper presents a microcontroller-based solution to classify blood glucose levels using acetone and ethanol breath
volatile organic compounds. Two metal oxide semiconductor-based chemical sensors able to detect acetone and ethanol
at parts per million concentrations were used. The sensors were tested in a controlled setup with humidified air spiked
with acetone and ethanol, mimicking human breath corresponding to low and high blood glucose groups. A support
vector machine algorithm was trained and implemented in a microcontroller. In a real time-time test, the trained
algorithm classified low and high blood glucose groups with 97% accuracy. Subsequently, a smart wristband prototype
that integrates the two sensors was developed. An Arduino-based wearable microcontroller platform was used for its
small formfactor and a low-power operation. The wristband is enclosed in a 3D printed housing and powered by an
onboard 3.7 V 500 mAh rechargeable Li-ion battery. A smartphone app communicates with the wristband through
Bluetooth, allows data visualization, and saves data in the cloud. The presented work makes a significant contribution
towards the development of a wearable device for detecting blood glucose levels from a patient’s breath.</p>
